# Etch-a-Sketch

In the HTML Doc ---
Create a button at the top a screen that will activate a prompt via javascript, which will ask for the number of squares per side (the size of all 4 sides will be determined with this single input.). The maximum input 
will be 100, and will return an error if it exceeds this number.

Create a div that will contain divs created by javascript to form the "etch-a-sketch."
-------------------


The total size of the grid will be static no matter the number of divs within it.

A variable containing the number of squares will determine the dimensions of the etch-a-sketch.

The default value for this variable will be 16. A grid will be formed in the DOM by default using this default value. This same function will be used in all grid creations, it's just invoked once by default.

For each increment of this value, create a row, in the column-flex container, with the specified number of squares. The number of rows will also be equal to this specified number.

Specify: flex 1 1 100% for each row and square.

All size specifications including margin, padding, gap, etc. should be percentage based to contain all contents within the content container.
